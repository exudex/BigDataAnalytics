    "# A10: Big Data Applications using Map Reduce \n",
    "##### by Kevin Nguyen (17 March 2017)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment we will be designing a Page Rank algorithm utilizing mapreduce in the cloudera HDFS environment via RHadoop. Page Rank is ranking webpages in order of importance and quality. The assumption is that webpages with more links from other webpages are more important. Page Rank is the algorithm used in Googleâ€™s search engine that helps determine what websites are shown to the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following instructions were followed for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tDesign a Map Reduce method to design the (key, val) structure for the page rank equation (the original version). \n",
    "2.\tWrite a code (either in R or another language) for implement the Map reduce method designed in Q1. Explain your code in a separate document and provide full comments in the code. \n",
    "3.\tRun Example 5.1 in the text book and find the final page ranking to validate your code. You should use \"hand\" calculation to generate the true solution to validate the outcome. The code must be functional to earn full credit. \n",
    "4.\tRun your code based on the web-Google.txt file. You need to compute the initial m(i,j) based on the data set first. show the top 10 highest ranked pages. The code must be functional to earn full credit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.Map Reduce Design Strategy \n",
    "\n",
    "The original page rank equation is v' = M * v. By running through mutliple iterations your page rank vector v will start converging to a 'final' page rank vector as you replace v with v'(v' = new page rank, v = current page rank) after each iteration.  There is no single 'correct' final page rank for any problem, the final page rank can change/differ due to the amount of iterations used or where you start your initial page rank vector. For a 'big data' file, 50-75 iterations are reccomended to get a good estimate of the final page rank vector. On the other hand, 'small data' files will converge very quickly and then you can pass the true final page rank (from a mathematical point of view) vector after a handful of iterations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our map reduce strategy using Rhadoop will be documented below. \n",
    "\n",
    "v' = M * v : a map reduce code to iteratively compute v=M * v where columuns of M adds to 1\n",
    "\n",
    "             M is n x n and v is n x 1\n",
    "             M is in the format of (i, j, mij), sum(mij)=1 over j           \n",
    "Example 5.1 from the Mining Massive Data Book will be the basis which we will use to help us lay the foundation for our strategy. \n",
